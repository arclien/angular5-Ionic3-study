So it looks like the browser has this built-in feature that seems very useful for creating new HTML elements from existing ones. Using it we can:

- define a public XML-like API to an element of the page
- define the look and feel of the element using HTML
- we can add behavior to that new element
- we can even style it while keeping those styles isolated

This combined specification of a look and feel, an API and a behavior is a useful concept, so let's give it a name: let's call it a Directive. This new directive will be a very particular type of HTML Directive: more than behavior, it has also an associated look and feel. We will call to that type of Directive a Component - it's simply a Directive with a template.



We’ve touched on a few directives already, such as NgFor.
Directives are components without a view. They are components without a template. Or to put it another way, components are directives with a view.
				
Everything you can do with a directive you can also do with a component. But not everything you can do with a component you can do with a directive.
